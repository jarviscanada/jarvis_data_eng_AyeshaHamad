## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AyeshaHamad](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AyeshaHamad)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AyeshaHamad/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Monitoring Agent for the Linux admin team with Bash Scripts, PostgreSQL, PSQL Client Tool, Crontab, SQL queries, Docker, etc. The LCA team can get hardware specifications and software utilization like memory/CPU management, and generate reports with the help of the data saved in the database and executing SQL queries. These reports will further help the LCA team to make decisions either they want to increase hardware/software specifications or not if the system is fully or underutilized.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AyeshaHamad/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App:
  - JDBC App: Designed a 'Customer Order Processing System' using JDBC, Data Access Object (DAO), and Data Transfer Object (DTO) Design Pattern, Postgres SQL, PSQL Client Tool, Maven, Docker to create Psql container, IntelliJ, and DBeaver. I have used JDBC to access data from RDBMS. The advantage of JDBC is that an application created using JDBC can access a variety of relational databases and run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine. In this application, you can read, write, update, and delete (CURD) data against an RDBMS database.
  - Grep App: Created a program to search a string from text files using ArrayList, FileReader/FileWriter, BufferedReader/BufferedWriter, Regex Pattern, Maven, and Docker to dockerize the app. This program works in a way that it traverses the 'root directory' that you enter and looks for files and sub-directories further in it. Searches the entered string in all those files and saves all matching lines to a text file.
